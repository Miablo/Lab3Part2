    (5 pts) Apply the Newton-Raphson's method xn+1 = xn – f '(xn) / f ''(xn) to develop a function double findMinMax(…)
    that returns a solution that is either a minimum value or a maximum value for z.
    The program finds a local minimum or a local maximum when the difference between the new solution and
    the previous one is smaller than 0.00001 within 10000 iterations. Otherwise, it shows Infinity as output.

    Let function z = x4+2y6 – xy – x + 2. Show the post-conditions for z.
    The preconditions for x and y are shown as below. Feel free to choose an arbitrary initial guess values x0 and
    y0 that meet the following precondition.

    |x| ≤ 6 and |y| ≤ 5
